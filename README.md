Python Pygame Mini Project. An interesting example of the application of coding to math and physics. A h-meter tall
man walks away from a H-meter lamp post at the rate of V0 m/sec. The light at the top of the post casts a shadow in
front of the man. How fast (rate is V1 m/sec) is the “head” of his shadow moving along the ground. Presented code, 
written with Python Pygame library demonstrates this animation of the physical situation. The proposed project is 
an illustration how coding helps to understand school math/physics, and vice versa, how math allows you to advance 
in the coding. Files for modeling this scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
